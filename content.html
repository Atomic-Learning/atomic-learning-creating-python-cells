<p>To insert a interactive Python cell in the <code>content.html</code> file of a page, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;py-cell&gt;
    # This is a Python cell
    print("Hello, Atomic Learning!")
&lt;/py-cell&gt;
</code></pre>

This will render as the following interactive Python cell:

<py-cell>
    # This is a Python cell
    print("Hello, Atomic Learning!")
</py-cell>

You can include as many Python cells as you like within the content of the page.
