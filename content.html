<p>To insert a interactive Python cell in the <code>content.html</code> file of a page, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;py-cell&gt;
# This is a Python cell
print("Hello, Atomic Learning!")&lt;/py-cell&gt;
</code></pre>

This will render as the following interactive Python cell:

<py-cell>
# This is a Python cell
print("Hello, Atomic Learning!")
</py-cell>

When defining a Python cell, it is advised to begin the Python code on a new line after the opening <code>&lt;py-cell&gt;</code> tag. It is also advised not to indent code by any spaces or tabs, unless this is required for the syntax of the Python code itself (e.g. within functions or loops). Finally, it is recommended to use the closing <code>&lt;/py-cell&gt;</code> tag on a new line immediately after the last line of Python code. These practices help ensure that the Python code in the cell does not have any unnecessary leading or trailing blank lines or spaces.
